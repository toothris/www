            The video itself was rendered at constant 60 fps rate and features
            perfectly smooth animation, so if you're seeing any twitches,
            the problem is likely in your system.
            Last time I checked, iPhone 4, MacBook Pro and Raspberry Pi B+
            played the video pretty well.

            I made this thingy back in 2008 over a course of 3 months.
            I wanted to create a game with very smooth animations and
            transitions all over the place.
            Before long I realized that on some platforms it's problematic
            even in principle to achieve consistent graphics performance.
            Moreover, the tools I chose made it difficult to port the game
            to more suitable platforms.
            In the end I decided to get the game to some stable point and
            stop there.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            I'm sharing all this in hope it might inspire some bright mind to
            create something beautiful.
            Or perhaps someone may even wish to finish this project and
            make a real game out of it.

          <h2>Features</h2>
          <p>Freeplay mode only: single infinite level with all gameplay
             elements. There's no end of the game or gradual levels
             progression.</p>
          <p>It runs on Arch Linux, but with a reasonable amount of
             <a href="https://github.com/toothris/toothris">effort</a>
             can be built on Windows or Mac OS X.</p>
          <p>It's written in Stackless Python. All game objects are
             separate microthreads communicating with each other.</p>
          <p>Game logic is deterministic. If you start with the same random
             seed and playback the same player inputs, you'll get the same
             results.</p>
          <p>It can record and playback demos. Comes in handy when debugging
             stuff or shooting gameplay videos.</p>

          <h2>Gameplay</h2>
          <p class="text-justify">
            The gameplay consists of two main parts: classical and extended.
            Classical part comes from the original Tetris game: there are 7
            different figures; each round a random figure is falling into the
            cup; whenever a horizontal line is completely filled with figures,
            it's being removed from the cup.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Extended gameplay part is unique to this game.
            It's based on two concepts: actions and bonuses.
            <strong>Action</strong> is something the player does
            (for example, rotate the figure full circle, or slam it against
            the cup).
            <strong>Bonus</strong> is something the player gets
            (for example, the ability to slam the figure all the way to the
            very bottom destroying every other figure in its way).</p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            After player has performed a given action with all 7 figures,
            he/she will get the corresponding bonus.
            There's a table in the right part of the game screen showing
            which actions with which figures were made.
            When the row in this table is complete, player gets the bonus
            to the left of this row.</p>
          <p>The game is controlled with <strong>arrow keys</strong>.
             The menu is navigated with <strong>mouse</strong>. There are
             7 actions and 7 bonuses. They are described below.</p></div>

          <p><strong>Drop:</strong> hold "down" button and slam the figure
            down hard.
            After dropping all 7 different figures you'll get Super Drop
            bonus.</p></div>

          <p><strong>Super Drop:</strong> when you slam the figure down,
            it'll go all the way to the very bottom of the cup, destroying
            every figure in its way.</p></div></div>
